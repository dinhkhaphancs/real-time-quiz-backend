# Real-Time Quiz Backend

A real-time quiz application backend built with Go, featuring WebSocket for real-time communication, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Redis for pub/sub functionality.

## Requirements

### Overview
The Real-Time Quiz application is designed to be a Kahoot-like platform where:
- **Admin users** can create quizzes, control the flow, and view results
- **Joiners** can participate in quizzes in real-time, answer questions, and view leaderboards

### Functional Requirements

#### User Roles
- **Admin**: Creates and manages quizzes, controls quiz flow, views all results
- **Joiner**: Joins quizzes with a unique ID, answers questions, views limited results

#### Quiz Flow
1. Admin creates a quiz with multiple questions
2. Joiners enter the quiz using a unique ID
3. Admin starts the quiz
4. Questions are presented one at a time with configurable time limits
5. Participants answer within the time limit
6. Scores are calculated based on correctness and speed
7. Leaderboard updates in real-time
8. Final results display at the end

#### Real-Time Requirements
- Synchronized quiz progression for all participants
- Instant feedback on answers
- Live leaderboard updates
- Server-controlled timing for fairness

### Technical Requirements
- **Backend**: Go with WebSockets for real-time communication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Caching**: Redis for pub/sub and temporary data
- **Architecture**: Clean, modular design with clear separation of concerns
